1. I have used "Project_Text_Classification1.ipynb" to save data into files "X.txt" and "Y.txt"
2. Reading of above said two files is being done in "Project_Text_Classification2.ipynb".
3. As Y_pred value was taking too much time. So, I stored that in 'Y_pred_my_clf.npz' file and used it in my Naive Baiyes Classifer implementation.

OR

You can use "Project_Text_Classification.ipynb" which does the above same task without any file reading and writing
